			<p><a href="https://www.railstutorial.org">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> by Michael Hartl -- This is probably the most
				widely used beginning Rails tutorial. It covers all the basic technologies to get your first web application up and running using Ruby on Rails, including cloud IDE setup, version control, deployment, and testing. It's kept up-to-date, covering Rails 5 as of this writing, and is completely free online. Also available in a print version if you prefer a hard copy. This one can't be recommended enough. </p>
			<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course">The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course</a> by Mashrur Hossain and Rob Percival on Udemy -- After completing the University program, I was looking for a different perspective and some advanced application walk-throughs. This course on Udemy was pretty good. At times, it felt too much like just typing what was on screen and not enough background learning, but the applications are fairly full-featured, and it allowed me to learn some technologies I hadn't yet used, like Stripe for payment processing. I was able to further my knowledge of Devise for authentication and AWS for image hosting.</p>
